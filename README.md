# hello-world
This is my Hello World program for learning GitHub

I am learning GitHub as part of the Part Time Code Immersion course for Tech Talent South and this is my first repository so bare with me! 
I'm already a professional developer, but I would like to gain a solid knowledge base of Ruby and Javascript to carry on in to further projects.
